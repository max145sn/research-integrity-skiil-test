description: Active statement-support grounding for cited claims. For each claim that leans on a citation, fetch the cited source and verify its CONTENT actually substantiates the claim — recording a span-backed verdict in a claim_grounding_report_v1 artifact. Generic across domains; routes HEP claims through INSPIRE and everything else through arXiv/OpenAlex. Run right after writing citation-backed prose (an introduction, related-work, or discussion section), before folding cited claims into durable artifacts, and before final conclusions.

# Claim Grounding (statement-support verification)

This skill answers the one citation question that existing tooling does **not**:
**does the cited source's content actually substantiate this specific claim?**

The provider tools already cover adjacent levels:

- **(E) existence** — does the cited paper resolve? (`inspire_validate_bibliography`, resolvers, `arxiv_paper_source`, `openalex_content`)
- **(S) stance** — does the citing context support/refute the cited work? (`inspire_grade_evidence`, citation graphs)
- **(I) identity** — whether the displayed title/authors and identifier/URL
  denote the same canonical work. This skill now consumes provider metadata or
  a `citation-triangulation` record and binds that identity before judging
  source content; bibliography formatting and dedup remain separate concerns.

What is missing is **(G) statement-support grounding**: fetching the cited source and
checking that *its text* backs the *author's assertion*. Today that is only the manual
`research-integrity` M3 step ("open the table and quote the value"). This skill makes it
an active, repeatable check that emits a structured, independently re-checkable artifact.

It is the active companion to `research-integrity` (M2 existence / M3 measurement) and the
active replacement for the static `folklore_risk_score` presence-heuristic.

## When to use

Run a grounding pass before any of:

- Promoting an idea card / folding claims into `research_contract.md` or `research_plan.md`.
- Requesting `nullius final-conclusions` (A5) on a run.
- Handing a claim set to `research-writer` / `referee-review`.

You may ground a subset early (e.g. during a literature pull) and a fuller pass at the
boundary. The boundary pass is the one that matters.

## Scope — which claims

Ground claims whose support rests on a citation:

- `support_type` ∈ {`literature`, `data`, `expert_consensus`} **with** `evidence_uris` → in scope.
- `calculation` → not here; numerical reproduction is the `research-harness` / numerical-grounding path.
- `llm_inference`, `assumption` → not a citation; these need their `verification_plan` executed, not a source fetched.

For literature-graph artifacts, treat the following as claim-like objects when they carry
interpretive content:

- edge explanations, such as "paper A extends method B" or "result X contrasts with result Y";
- figure-candidate relevance statements, such as "this extracted figure shows the effect summarized in the note";
- connected-literature sidebar summaries that assert lineage, contrast, application, or source support.

The grounding target is the statement behind the graph element, not the visual element itself.
If the edge or figure has no source locator or evidence URI, record it as ungrounded rather
than inferring support from graph proximity.

## Procedure (per in-scope claim)

1. **Route by domain.** HEP sources (`inspirehep.net`, `hep-ph/ex/th/lat`, INSPIRE recids)
   resolve through INSPIRE; everything else through arXiv/OpenAlex. (The shared helper
   `classifyEvidenceDomain(uri)` gives the same hint; override per-claim when you know better.)
2. **Bind the human-facing citation to canonical metadata.** For each
   `evidence_uri`, record the displayed title, displayed authors when present,
   displayed identifier and URL, then compare them deterministically with
   canonical provider metadata. The exact metadata response must be hash-bound;
   it may come from an authoritative retrieval, an already archived canonical
   record, or a `citation-triangulation` artifact. Archived canonical metadata
   is sufficient and does not require the network to be available again. If no
   archived record exists and authoritative retrieval is unavailable, record
   `metadata_unavailable`; a load-bearing citation cannot pass. If any displayed
   field names a different work, record `mismatch` with the exact diagnostic.
   When one work has several provider identifiers or URLs, record those exact
   alternatives in canonical `locator_aliases`; shared code deliberately does
   not guess provider-specific equivalence.
3. **Confirm existence.** Resolve each `evidence_uri`. If a source cannot be resolved, the
   verdict for that claim is `source_unavailable` — stop, do not guess.
4. **Fetch the relevant source content** (not just the abstract when the claim is specific):

   | Domain | Fetch the cited source with |
   | --- | --- |
   | HEP | `inspire_paper_source` / `arxiv_paper_source` (+ `pdf_parse` for PDF-only); `pdg_get_measurements` / `hepdata_get_table` when the claim cites a measurement |
   | general | `openalex_content` / `arxiv_paper_source` (+ `pdf_parse` for PDF-only) |

5. **Judge support against the fetched text.** Locate the passage (section / equation /
   table / figure) that bears on the claim and decide whether it substantiates the claim.
6. **Record a verdict** from: `substantiated`, `partial`, `not_substantiated`, `conflicting`,
   `source_unavailable`.

For graph figure candidates, do not use a title page, abstract, or filename as evidence that
the image is relevant. The supporting span must identify the actual result, table, figure,
equation, or discussion that the rendered asset is meant to carry.

## The non-negotiable rule: quote the span

**A `substantiated` or `partial` verdict MUST carry at least one verbatim span quoted from
the fetched source** (with a locator — section/equation/table/figure/page). If you cannot
quote the source text that grounds the claim, the claim is **not** grounded: record
`not_substantiated`.

## Citation identity is a prior gate, not something full text can repair

A verbatim supporting span proves only that the opened source says something;
it does not prove that the title and link shown to the reader identify that
source. Every `substantiated` or `partial` entry therefore requires exactly one
derived `citation_identities` check per `evidence_uri`, with verdict `matched`.

- `mismatch` is a hard grounding failure. The shared contract downgrades a
  positive verdict to `not_substantiated` and records diagnostics such as
  `title_mismatch`, `authors_mismatch`, or `displayed_identifier_mismatch`.
  Completing a full-text claim check cannot compensate for this failure.
- `metadata_unavailable` downgrades a positive verdict to
  `source_unavailable`. Do not silently treat an unverified displayed title as
  canonical merely because its URL resolves.
- A canonical identifier reused under two different displayed titles must
  expose at least one mismatch. Conflicting canonical metadata for the same
  identifier invalidates the report rather than allowing either record to pass.
- The stored identity verdict and diagnostics are derived from the recorded
  input at both assembly and parse time. Hand-editing `matched` into a report is
  rejected, just like hand-editing a numeric comparison verdict.

This is enforced mechanically. `assembleClaimGroundingReport` (in `@nullius/shared`,
`packages/shared/src/claim-grounding.ts`) **downgrades any span-less substantiated/partial
verdict to `not_substantiated`**, and the report parser rejects it otherwise. So a verdict
of "substantiated" with no quote is impossible to ship — by design. Quote the line, the
equation, or the exact value+uncertainty; do not paraphrase a vibe.

## Match claims: "reproduces / matches a published value" is grounded by computing, not quoting

A claim whose assertion is that **[a result] reproduces / matches / agrees with [a published
numeric value]** is a special case the span rule does **not** discharge. Quoting the published
number from its source confirms only that the *source* carries that value — it does **not**
establish that *your* result matches it. A match claim is grounded **only by computing the
claimed observable on a comparable state / regime / configuration and comparing it to the
published value numerically**; this routes to the numerical-reproduction path
(`numerical-reliability-gate` **G8**, the active compute-and-compare gate), not to a
text-entailment span. So:

- A "reproduces / matches a published value" claim whose *only* support is a span quoting the
  published number is **`not_substantiated`** — the quote grounds the source's value, not the
  agreement. A purely qualitative "same order of magnitude / same sign / right scale" claim with
  no computed comparison is likewise ungrounded.
- When the comparison **is** computed: record it structurally as a `numeric_match` entry — the
  computed (claimed) value, the source value, their stated uncertainties, and an explicit
  tolerance policy go in the entry's `numeric_comparison` field (see the numeric_match section
  below), and the comparison verdict is **recomputed from that input by the contract**, never
  taken on assertion. The coupling is mechanical: a computed `mismatch` — which includes any
  order-of-magnitude same-direction discrepancy or sign reversal — forces the grounding verdict
  to `conflicting` (the computed result actively contradicts the asserted match;
  `substantiated`/`partial` are impossible), and an `incomparable` comparison cannot be
  `substantiated`. If the claim itself asserts only loose agreement, encode that looseness in
  the tolerance policy up front — do not label a beyond-tolerance result `partial`. The
  comparable regime, and any gap to the reference's regime, still go in `notes`.

This is the citation-side companion of the `Scope` rule above (a bare `calculation` claim is the
`research-harness` / numerical path): a match claim wears citation clothing — it carries
`evidence_uris` to the published source — yet its support is a **computation**, so quoting the
source is necessary context but never sufficient grounding.

## Transcription fidelity (when the claim was transcribed into a note)

When the claim you are grounding was itself **transcribed into a deep-read / extraction note**
— it carries a quoted equation, a numeric value + uncertainty, or a source locator copied from
the cited source — grounding has a second dimension beyond "does the source support the claim":
**does the note's quoted span / value / locator match the fetched source span?** A claim can be
*true* yet mis-transcribed (a flipped sign, a transposed digit, a dropped magnitude factor, a
stale locator, or a quote labeled "verbatim" after silent normalization). Compare the note's
quote/value/locator against the span you fetched in step 4:

- If the fetched span does **not** match what the note transcribed, the verdict is
  `not_substantiated` (the source does not ground the note as written), or `conflicting` if the
  source actively contradicts it — record the **fetched** span verbatim in `supporting_spans`
  so the drift is auditable, and name the mismatch in `notes`.
- A `substantiated` / `partial` verdict therefore certifies *both* that the source supports the
  claim *and* that the note transcribed it faithfully — the quoted span is the same object for
  both checks.

This is the active execution of the `research-integrity` *Extraction / transcription fidelity*
checklist (items (a)–(o)); `deep-literature-review` produces the notes this dimension grounds.

## Output — `claim_grounding_report_v1`

Emit one `claim_grounding_report_v1.json` for the claim set, conforming to the
`ClaimGroundingReportV1` contract in `@nullius/shared`
(`packages/shared/src/claim-grounding.ts` — the single source of truth for the shape).

This is an intentional pre-release tightening of the v1 shape: an older v1
report without `citation_identities` is unbound and is rejected. Regenerate it
from canonical metadata; do not grandfather its earlier positive verdict.

- **Do not set `verification_status` yourself.** It is derived from the verdict by the
  contract (`substantiated`→`verified`, `conflicting`→`falsified`, everything else→`unverified`).
  A failed-to-support citation is `unverified`, not `falsified` — only an active source
  contradiction (`conflicting`) falsifies a claim.
- `grounding_risk_score` (0..1, higher = riskier) is computed from the verdicts; surface it
  next to the boundary-crossing action.
- **Do not set citation-identity verdicts yourself.** Supply the identity input;
  `assembleClaimGroundingReport` derives `matched` / `mismatch` /
  `metadata_unavailable`, and the parser recomputes the same result.
- Every `supporting_spans[].evidence_uri` must name one of the entry's
  `evidence_uris`; text copied from another source cannot ground this citation.

## Writing back into the claims

`verification_status` and `verification_notes` are schema-allowed idea-card claim fields.
The pure helper `applyGroundingToClaims(claims, report)` returns an updated claims array with
those two fields set from the report (matched by `claim_index`), leaving every other field
untouched. **Default to writing a grounded copy** (e.g. `*_grounded.json`); only overwrite the
original idea-card when the owner asks — staged handoff artifacts are otherwise treated as
immutable.

## numeric_match — grounding a numeric claim by computed comparison

Use `method: "numeric_match"` when the core assertion of the claim IS a number — a measured
value, an interval bound, a ratio, a coefficient — and the cited source carries a comparable
number. When the number is incidental context to a textual assertion, stay with
`text_entailment`.

Procedure, on top of the per-claim procedure above:

1. **Locate the source value** through the same domain routing. HEP measurement values
   resolve via `pdg_get_measurements` / `hepdata_get_table` (or the cited paper's own
   table); everything else via the fetched paper's tables / text. The supporting span MUST
   quote the source's number verbatim — value, uncertainty, and locator. The span rule
   applies to numeric_match entries unchanged: no quoted source-value context, no
   substantiated/partial verdict.
2. **Bring both sides to the same units and conventions first.** The comparison helper
   performs NO unit or convention conversion — converting units, scale factors, and
   sign/normalization conventions is your job before recording the comparison. On a
   surprising `mismatch`, audit for a unit or convention difference before anything else.
3. **Record the comparison** in the entry's `numeric_comparison.input`: claimed value with
   its stated uncertainty, source value with its stated uncertainty, and an EXPLICIT
   tolerance policy (`absolute`, `relative`, or `uncertainty_multiple`). If the source
   states an uncertainty you MUST transcribe it — omitting a stated uncertainty widens what
   the check can excuse, and the verbatim span quoting the value makes the omission
   auditable. When neither side genuinely states an uncertainty, you must say so
   explicitly: set `no_stated_uncertainty: true` in the input — a tolerance-based
   confirmation without uncertainties and without that attestation comes back
   `incomparable`, so silent omission can never confirm. Attesting falsely (the span shows
   an uncertainty right next to the value) is fabrication on the same level as a fake
   verbatim quote.
4. **Let the contract derive the verdict.** `compareNumericClaim` (in
   `@nullius/shared`, `packages/shared/src/numeric-claim-match.ts`) recomputes the
   comparison verdict and details from the recorded input at both assembly and parse time;
   a hand-written comparison verdict the input does not reproduce is rejected. Machine-readable
   details record the actual deviation, the tolerance applied, and the decision path.

### Choosing the tolerance honestly

- **Statistical compatibility** ("this result agrees with the published value"): use
  `uncertainty_multiple` with a small multiple (conventionally two to three).
- **Transcription fidelity** ("the source carries this exact number"): use `absolute` or
  `relative` at the rounding precision of the quoted digits.
- **A tolerance wider than five times the combined uncertainty is non-diagnostic** and the
  comparison comes back `incomparable`, never `within_tolerance`: an acceptance window that
  would also pass values decisively different from the source value certifies nothing. This
  is the falsification philosophy of the numerical-reliability gate applied to claim
  grounding — a check too coarse to fail is not a check. The guard blocks confirmation
  only: a difference beyond even an over-wide tolerance is still a `mismatch` (a weak test
  can falsify; it cannot corroborate).
- A claim asserting only loose, order-of-magnitude agreement between precisely-known values
  cannot be confirmed through a tolerance the uncertainties render non-diagnostic; ground it
  as `text_entailment` with explicit reasoning in `notes`, or tighten the claim.
- With no uncertainty stated on either side the guard has no scale to judge against, so
  confirmation additionally requires the explicit `no_stated_uncertainty: true` attestation
  (see step 3); the result is then `within_tolerance` with decision path
  `within_tolerance_no_uncertainty` — treat it as the weaker footing it is. Without the
  attestation the comparison is `incomparable` (`uncertainty_not_attested`). An exact
  equality of the two numbers needs no attestation — there is no tolerance window to
  gerrymander — and a beyond-tolerance `mismatch` is never blocked either.

### Verdict coupling (mechanical, enforced at assembly and parse)

| Comparison verdict | Effect on the grounding verdict |
| --- | --- |
| `exact` / `within_tolerance` | `substantiated` allowed (the span rule still applies) |
| `mismatch` | `substantiated`/`partial` impossible — downgraded to `conflicting` |
| `incomparable` | `substantiated` impossible — downgraded to `not_substantiated`; `partial` stays available |
| no comparison recorded | `substantiated`/`partial` impossible — downgraded to `not_substantiated` |

A `mismatch` never mechanically upgrades a verdict the agent already marked negative
(`not_substantiated` stays), because a mismatch can stem from a caller-side unit or
convention error — falsification of the claim remains the agent's judgment, taken with the
recorded deviation in view.

Entry shape as YOU supply it to `assembleClaimGroundingReport` (one `numeric_match` entry;
the domain/routing follows the claim's source exactly as in the main procedure — this
example uses the general route):

```json
{
  "claim_index": 3,
  "claim_text": "The reported coefficient is 1.2 with uncertainty 0.1 in the stated units.",
  "support_type": "literature",
  "evidence_uris": ["https://doi.org/10.1000/example"],
  "domain": "general",
  "method": "numeric_match",
  "verdict": "substantiated",
  "supporting_spans": [
    { "evidence_uri": "https://doi.org/10.1000/example", "quote": "we obtain 1.19 +- 0.05", "locator": "Table 2" }
  ],
  "numeric_comparison": {
    "input": {
      "claimed_value": 1.2,
      "claimed_uncertainty": 0.1,
      "source_value": 1.19,
      "source_uncertainty": 0.05,
      "tolerance": { "kind": "uncertainty_multiple", "multiple": 2 }
    }
  }
}
```

Do not hand-write `numeric_comparison.verdict` or `details` — supply only the `input` as
above and let `assembleClaimGroundingReport` derive them. The assembled report then carries
the derived `verdict` plus a full `details` object (signed/absolute/relative deviation,
combined uncertainty, sigma distance, the tolerance applied, the machine-readable
`decision_path`, and a `reason`); the parser rejects a recorded verdict or decision path
that the recorded input does not reproduce. All numeric scalars stored in the report must
be finite — NaN/Infinity do not survive JSON and are rejected at validation.

## What this skill is NOT

- Not a re-implementation of any provider tool. The tool names above point at existing
  `inspire_*` / `openalex_*` / `arxiv_*` / `pdg_*` / `hepdata_*` / `pdf_*` capabilities;
  this skill decides which to call per claim and turns their output into a grounded verdict.
- Not a replacement for `citation-triangulation`. Triangulation establishes
  cross-provider metadata agreement; the identity rule here additionally binds
  that canonical metadata to the title/authors/identifier/URL actually displayed
  in the consuming citation.
- Not a replacement for the A5 / final-conclusions gate or for `research-integrity`. It makes
  M2/M3 active and produces the artifact those disciplines otherwise record by hand.
- Not a way to mark a claim grounded without a source quote — see the span rule.
